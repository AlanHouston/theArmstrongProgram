Welcome to my first ever application!!

This is a basic tracker for the Armstrong program found here http://armstrongpullupprogram.com/.

"This program was used by Major Charles Lewis Armstrong, USMC to prepare himself to attempt to set a world record in number of pull-ups completed in a single exercise session."

There are four different workouts to be done in five consecutive days; the final day workout is chosen by the user as the toughest of the four workouts in that particular week. User is instructed to rest the other two days of the week.

I decided to create this app because I occasionally participate in the program and get frustrated with having to refer to a note on my phone to access previous data in order to compare results.

In the appliction, for each workout, past data automatically reloads at the bottom of the page for easy access to dates, which sets, how many, etc.

Functionality is basic for now, but the data is maintained in mlab.

Functionality to come:
*Styling
*Client side routing
*authentication
*Edit buttons: User is currently unable to edit their current session data upon completion
*Pushup tracker: the program requires three max sets of pushups every morning of the five workout days

I encourage everyone to give this program a shot! If the program is too advanced, the creator has a beginner program found here http://armstrongpullupprogram.com/the-pre-armstrong-workout-for-pull-up-beginners/. 
If your arms are huge, you are a tough guy/gal, or you just find this program elementary, he also created and advanced program found here http://armstrongpullupprogram.com/armstrong-advanced/.

I have not created an app for these, but I might some day! 

Thanks for checking out my handsome coding!
